# ZombieSurvivor
A virtual slice level of a potential game made by Joshua Keene, Beatriz Folgado and Dominique Russell. It was a non-assessment piece from a digital art and technology module. I (Dominique) created the scripts, the UI, the HUD, added music and the menu screens and used Mixamo to add animations to the guards. I also took care of project management making use of a Trello board and directing my peers as to what aspects they would work on. I contributed to the game's design with Joshua Keene taking care of most of it and also putting together the level aesthetics using pre-made assets. Beatriz Folgado helped with level design and the creation of textures.
